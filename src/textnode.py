#n textnode.py create a class called TextNode. It should have 3 properties that can be set in the constructor:
#self.text - The text content of the node
#self.text_type - The type of text this node contains, which is just a string like "bold" or "italic"
#self.url - The URL of the link or image, if the text is a link. Default to None if nothing is passed in.
